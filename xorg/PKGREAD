##### PKGREADME: alsa-utils


README for alsa-utils

alsa-utils includes an init script in /etc/rc.d called "alsa". In order to
save and restore your soundcard mixer levels at shutdown and boot, add
"alsa" to the SERVICES array in /etc/rc.conf.

NOTE: If the "alsa" init script attempts to restore mixer levels that have
not been saved yet, it will produce an error that looks like:

"alsactl: load_state:1677: Cannot open /var/lib/alsa/asound.state for
reading: No such file or directory"

This just means that the mixer settings have not yet been saved and can be
fixed by running "alsactl store".

##### PKGREADME: fontconfig
POST-INSTALL

  After upgrading fontconfig, always run rejmerge and upgrade
  /etc/fonts/fonts.conf and /etc/fonts/fonts.dtd.


  /etc/fonts/conf.avail ships with configuration snippets that can be
  symlinked from /etc/fonts/conf.d to enable them.
  It's recommended to use these snippets instead of duplicating XML code
  in your /etc/fonts/local.conf.

  For more information on conf.avail/conf.d, please see:
  http://cgit.freedesktop.org/fontconfig/plain/conf.d/README

  For more information on fontconfig, please see:

##### PKGREADME: librsvg

README for librsvg

POST-INSTALL

	To register SVG as a loadable module for gdk-pixbuf you must run:

	# gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders --update-cache

	To do that also you can execute the post-install script.
##### PKGREADME: libva
Please install a backend driver for libva to function on your graphics card.

libva-vdpau-driver: vdpau back-end for nvidia
libva-intel-driver: back-end for intel cards (currently called libva-intel)

##### PKGREADME: mesa3d
Install libva before building mesa to get hardware acceleration for the
following drivers:

usr/lib/dri/nouveau_drv_video.so
usr/lib/dri/r600_drv_video.so
usr/lib/dri/radeonsi_drv_video.so
##### PKGREADME: pulseaudio
If you are not running a fully fledged DE you might have trouble
with pulseaudio shutting down after being idle for a while. You can
work around this by starting pulseaudio like this:

~/.xinitrc
#!/bin/bash
pulseaudio --start --exit-idle-time=-1 --log-target=syslog &
exec /usr/bin/myawesomewm
##### PKGREADME: shared-mime-info
README for shared-mime-info

INSTALL

POST-INSTALL
- Run the post-install script to update the MIME data.

PRECAUTION
##### PKGREADME: sxiv
The configuration of sxiv is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code. To create a custom config.h,
unpack the tarball, copy the file sxiv-$version/config.def.h to
sxiv's port directory, and edit to suit your preferences. Then,
when you call pkgmk in the sxiv port directory, the custom
config.h will be detected and copied into the source before
compilation. I recommend that you save a copy your custom config.h
some where other than the sxiv port directory, so that your changes
won't get nuked when updating ports or performing a prtsweep or
prtwash (see opt/prt-utils for more information about those two).

Another solution for customizing sxiv is to create a custom and
(preferably) private port that contains your custom config and also
might include patches for added features.
##### PKGREADME: xorg-server
WARNING:

  If you fail to rebuild input and video packages for xorg-server
  on major ABI changes, eg. 1.16.0 -> 1.17.0. You will end up with
  no mouse or keyboard and possibly no direct 3D acceleration for video.

  If you do happen to forget and have sys-rq enabled in your kernel
  you can do a safe reboot with holding down Alt + SysRq, and typing the
  following sequence in order, pausing for several seconds between each key:

  reisub

PRE-INSTALL

	xorg-server 1.16 new dependency libepoxy
	xorg-server 1.16 removed dependency xorg-glamor-egl
	xorg-server 1.17 new dependency xorg-xcb-util-keysyms
	xorg-server 1.17 removed dependency xorg-xf86-video-modesetting

	The current version of xorg-server needs these packages sorted out before 
	a prt-get sysup from crux 3.1 release is done.

prt-get remove xorg-xf86-video-modesetting xorg-glamor-egl
prt-get depinst libepoxy xorg-xcb-util-keysyms

POST-INSTALL

  After upgrading xorg-server, from major versions rebuild video
  and input packages:

  NOTE: This only applies on ABI changes between major versions
  eg, 1.16.0 -> 1.17.0.

prt-get update -fr $(prt-get listinst --regex '^xorg-xf86-(input|video)|^mesa3d')

  If you use nvidia you also need to do this:

gl-select use xorg && gl-select use nvidia
